                I am a visual artist with over 4 years of experience in Photoshop and Illustrations. I specialise in illustrations and mass reach posters and other mediums.


                <br> <br> During my experience, I have served as the secretary and the Acting Vice President of the computer club between 2017-18 and later as the head of the digital imaging department between 2018-19 while as serving as the president
                of the student council. I also recieved the Vice Chairperson's award for literary activites for the 2017-18 for heading the Yearbook and ensuring smooth execution. My complete resume can be found
                <a href="assets/resume.pdf?track=rb.in">
                    <!-- track resume clicks-->here </a>
                <br> <br> I also code in <b>Node.JS </b>specialising in Express EJS and mongoDB and I am currently learn the MERN Stack to execute full stsck websites organically. My prokects and tests can be found on my github however clients who wish
                privacy remain as private repositories!

                <br> <br> During my free time I attempt to read various books. I am currently reading <b>12 rules of Life by Professor Jordan Brent Peterson</b> and many more. I also listen to various genres of music which can be found on my <b>spotify</b>.
                <br> <br> My current machine is a <b> 2017 i5 Macbook Air</b> with 8GB of ram. While relatively underpowered, it is perfect for my workload and my mobile lifestyle. All my projects are ideated and made on this machine. I also own a <b>OnePlus 6T</b>                which is ridiculously over powered and due to my inability of using my phone for anything more than <b>Reddit</b> I can't seem to overpower ever.
                <br> <br> Due to my intensive Course and other activites I am unable to find time to redecorate my website, however I believe that actions speak louder than words please consider heading to my work to know more.

                <br><br> I am also a die hard fan of Formula 1. If you are here to read my opinions on the current season please head to my blog at <a href="https://blog.rahulbatra.in">here</a>. The blog is a work in progress and will be completed soon!
