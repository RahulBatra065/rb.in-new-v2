    <h3>Equilibria'20</h3>
    I made 3 individual back end systems purely on Node.JS and MongoDB (NoSQL) <br>
    <h5>QR Code Passes</h5> <br> The college fest hosts multiple smaller events before the actual fest to hype the main fest. The issue with these is to control the flow of the crowd as well as to understand when maximum amount of crowd came in to optimize
    both security and event timings. In the past the fest had also experienced multiple events of unruly crowd getting in by faking a pass which were just mass printed tickets with no actual identifiers on them. I implemented a custom QR code on every
    pass which was unique to each pass.These QR codes were just a standard a website with a query request of random string at the end. When the data was requested the website would query the server to make a decision whether the pass is valid or not.
    At it's peak it handled ~1000 RPS on a system which was implemented on the free tier of heroku and MongoDB, I also monitored health using NewRelic and some custom scripts I had written because of my paranoia.
    <h5>Online Registration System</h5>
    The fest also lacked any online system was registering for the various events that were a part of the fest.The only alternative they had was google forms which wasnt the most professional form. I created a form with a backend where event co-ordinators
    could login and check the registrations sorted event wise and a master admin key to the Core Council. This was also implemented using the same tiers on Heroku and MongoDB. An email was sent to the participant as a confirmation with a unique 'Team
    ID'

    <h5>Internal Registration System</h5>
    Various teams would go out to various colleges in an attempt to get people to register for events. This chaotic procedure also involved sometimes losing track of money that they recieved and more often than not, losing contact details. I took the registration
    system with a custom Log-In page with used SHA256 to make an internal form for the teams which would make their jobs rather efficient and they wouldn't have to keep a track of pieces of paper which they wrote the details on. An email would also be
    sent to the participant as a confirmation along with a unique 'Team ID'.
